## Contributing Guidelines

Developers are highly welcome to contribute to this project by modifying the existing solutions to more optimized solutions or add new programs that fit into the various categories mentioned in the repo or adding a new category if needed.

* Look at the issues created already and get yourself assigned for the issues by commenting there. Issues will be assigned on FCFS basis. 
* Create a new issue whether you are adding a new program or optimizing the existing solution. After the issue is assigned to you, start working on it and make a pull request as mentioned in the steps below.
* When creating a PR, make sure to add the linked issue in the description. For example : "Closes #133"

1. Fork this repository
1. Clone the repo ```git clone <YOUR_FORKED_REPO_URL>```
1. CD into the specific directory. Create a new branch of the master ```git branch <NEW_BRANCH_NAME>```
1. You can check which branch you are in using ```git branch``` . Now checkout to the new branch created. ```git checkout <BRANCH_NAME>```
1. Make the changes and submit a PR if you are providing optimized or alternative solution to an existing problem. If you want to add a new problem and provide solution 
then create an issue and wait till it is assigned to you and then work on it and submit your PR which then will be reviewed.
1. When you are done coding, stage the changes by using the command ```git add``` .

the PR and merge it with the master branch.

*Note : **Contributions in any form (Code, Documentation, etc) submitted should be the own work of the contributor and plagiarism is highly discouraged.***

Happy Coding!!!
