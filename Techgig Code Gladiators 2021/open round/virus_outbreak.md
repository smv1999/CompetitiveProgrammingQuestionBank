## Virus Outbreak
***
In the Martian land faraway, a new virus has evolved and is attacking the individuals at a fast pace. The scientists have figured out the virus composition, V. The big task is to identify the people who are infected. The sample of N people is taken to check if they are POSITIVE or NEGATIVE. A report is generated which provides the current blood composition B of the person. 

#### POSITIVE or NEGATIVE ?

If the blood composition of the person is a subsequence of the virus composition V, then the person is identified as POSITIVE otherwise NEGATIVE.

#### Example:

Virus Composition, V = coronavirus
Blood Composition of the person , B = ravus

The person in question is POSITIVE as B is the subsequence of the V. 

The scientists are busy with their research for medicine and request you to build a program which can quickly figure out if the person is POSITIVE or NEGATIVE. They will provide you with the virus composition V and all the people’s current blood composition. Can you help them?

^Note: The virus and blood compositions are lowercase alphabet strings.^
